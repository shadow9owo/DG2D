- 2dCamera i will have to implement a 2d camera in which update i will completely revamp rendering so everything is stored in a completely seperate buffer => so we rely less on sdl2

- .INI wrapper - simple but worth it

- I want to rely way less on sdl2 right now i am relying on it a lot which will most likely not change much but i want to only rely only on it as needed. I dont want to have everything be sdl dependent which will most likely change in future as of right now were in really early stages of development
