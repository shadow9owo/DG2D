- 2DCamera i will have to implement a 2DCamera system. In which i will completely revamp rendering so everything is stored in a completely seperate buffer (excluded from the window buffer before applying it to it).

- I want to rely way less on sdl2 right now. I am relying on it too much, and thats bad. Either way i want to cut down on dependencies. 

- Late in development i want to fork this project, and actually turn this into an all in one game engine. Using qt6 ,QCodeEditor (code editor), Tiled like level editor, debugger , basic local package manager that lets you disable and enable components.
