- 2DCamera i will have to implement a 2D camera in which update i will completely revamp rendering so everything is stored in a completely seperate buffer => so we rely less on sdl2

- .INI wrapper - simple but worth it

- I want to rely way less on sdl2 right now i am relying on it too much and thats bad either way i want to cut down on dependencies 

- Late in development i want to fork this project and actually turn this into an all in one game engine using qt6 ,QCodeEditor (code editor), Tiled like level editor, debugger , basic local package manager that lets you disable and enable components
